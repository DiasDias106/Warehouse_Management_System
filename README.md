# 🏭 **Warehouse Management System**

**Warehouse Management System** is a program developed in **C**, designed to organize and efficiently manage data related to **clients**, **sales**, and **products**.  
The application operates entirely through **text file processing**, enabling structured reading, analysis, and modification of stored information.

---

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

- The program reads and processes structured text files containing warehouse data.  
- An **interactive menu system** allows navigation between modules.  
- Each module manages a different entity: **Clients**, **Sales**, and **Products**.  
- Users can add, remove, search, update, and list records dynamically.  
- Data is stored and updated directly within the text files, maintaining persistence across sessions.

## ✨ **Main Features**

- 📂 **File Reading & Parsing:** Extracts and organizes data from structured `.txt` files.  
- 🧭 **Interactive Menu:** Divided into three main sections:  
  - 👤 **Client Management**  
  - 💰 **Sales Management**  
  - 📦 **Product Management**  
- 👥 **Client Management:**  
  - Add, remove, and update client records.  
  - Search and list clients dynamically.  
- 🛒 **Sales & Product Modules:**  
  - Similar management options with add/remove/search/update functionality.  
- 🧩 **Modular Code Design:** Implements core C programming principles — including file handling, arrays, structs, and control flow.
