# 🏭 *C Warehouse Management System*

*C Warehouse Management System* is a program developed in *C, designed to organize and efficiently manage data related to **clients, **sales, and **products*.  
The application operates entirely through *text file processing*, enabling structured reading, analysis, and modification of stored information.

---

## ⚙️ *How It Works*

- The program reads and processes structured text files containing warehouse data.  
- An *interactive menu system* allows navigation between modules.  
- Each module manages a different entity: *Clients, **Sales, and **Products*.  
- Users can add, remove, search, update, and list records dynamically.  
- Data is stored and updated directly within the text files, maintaining persistence across sessions.

## ✨ *Main Features*

- 📂 *File Reading & Parsing:* Extracts and organizes data from structured .txt files.  
- 🧭 *Interactive Menu:* Divided into three main sections:  
  - 👤 *Client Management*  
  - 💰 *Sales Management*  
  - 📦 *Product Management*  
- 👥 *Client Management:*  
  - Add, remove, and update client records.  
  - Search and list clients dynamically.  
- 🛒 *Sales & Product Modules:*  
  - Similar management options with add/remove/search/update functionality.  
- 🧩 *Modular Code Design:* Implements core C programming principles — including file handling, arrays, structs, and control flow.
